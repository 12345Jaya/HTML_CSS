Float
-----
It allows other elements to float around it.

. Consider a div having three paragraph elements below it. Now we can see that text is below the div, we have div in a small size and we want text to come aside the div (wrap around)

. It can be used well for block level elements like divs, images.

. float: left;
  float: right;

. Sometimes these elements can be overflown out of the boxes when screen is small, then we can give,
  display: flow-root;

Overflow
--------
Property that sets the desired behaviour when content does not fit in the parent element box (overflows)

. If text goes out of div, it is nothing but overflow.

. overflow: visible;  //We can see the overflow text
  overflow: hidden;   //we can't see the text that is out of the div

. To view the overflow content upto some value we use,
  overflow: clip;
  overflow-clip-margin: 13px;

. To view the content within the box, we can use scrolling
  overflow: scroll;

. To automatically decide the element to have scroll bar or not we need to give 
  overflow: auto;
