Position
--------
1) position: static;   // default
2) position: relative; // relative to where it normally is
3) position: absolute; // relative to nearest ancestor
4) position: fixed;    // fixed to the view port
5) position: sticky;   // based on scroll position

top:100px;(comes down) left:100px;(comes right)
top:-100px; (goes up)  left:-100px; (goes left)

1) static -> initially all the ele are static, they are not effected by top, bottom, left and right.

2) relative -> it is positioned wrt to current window.
            -> ele is positioned by top, bottom, left and right.
            -> although ele is moved, original gap is maintained. (gap is intact)

3) absolute -> when there is a need of overlapping.
            -> top, left, bottom, right are applied according to closest relative ancestor. (relative to Closest positioned ancestor)
            -> position -> absolute => the ele search for the parent which is relative and makes it as axis otherwise makes coordinates as screen.
            -> gap is not maintained.

4) fixed   -> it remains fixed wrt window. (it is positioned intact in entire web page)

5) sticky  -> it remains sticky when we give coordinates top, left, bottom, right.
           -> it remains sticky within the container it is present.
